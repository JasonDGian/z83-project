# ðŸ“Œ Minisforum Z83-F mod project.
Greetings, and welcome to my Minisforum Mini PC mod project!   
In this repository, I'll be documenting my journey as I analyze, test, and work to enhance the performance and functionality of the Minisforum Mini PC.

## :moyai: A little bit about me.
Before diving into the project, here's some context: I'm a tinkerer at heart. I love hands-on projects like this oneâ€”theyâ€™re my idea of fun. While some might see this as a waste of time and effort, these so-called 'useless projects' are how I stay entertained and deepen my understanding of topics I'm passionate about, such as electronics, operating systems, programming, and IT in general. For me, making mistakes and figuring out how to fix them is far more productive than passively watching tutorials on YouTube all night. It's how I learn best, so I donâ€™t consider any time spent on this project truly wastedâ€”as long as I learn something along the way.

## :computer: What is the device exactly?

The Minisforum Z83-F is a compact fanless and silent _System-on-a-Chip_ mini PC of reduced dimensions that includes many desireble functionalities on a daily work computer. It sports an Intel Atom x5-Z8350 processor with 4GB of DDR3 RAM and a 64GB SSD. It also comes pre-loaded with Windows 10 Pro.

The Z83-F also offers connectivity options such as Wi-Fi 2.4GHz/5.8GHz and Bluetooth 4.0, allowing for seamless wireless connectivity with other devices. With ports including USB 2.0, USB 3.0, HDMI, VGA, and an SD card slot, you have a variety of options for connecting peripherals and expanding storage.
For a more detailed exporation of the system hardware see the [detailed hardware analysis](hardware.md) section.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: The problem to solve.
The Minis Forum Z83-F, like many other mini PCs, adopts a fanless design for improved silence and reduced power consumption. While this design choice has its benefits, it also presents a notable issue: **poor heat dissipation**. The absence of a fan restricts the device's ability to cool down effectively, leading to increased temperatures and potential performance degradation.

Although fanless designs aim to prioritize quiet operation, they often compromise on thermal management. This compromises the overall longevity and usability of the device, especially in situations where the workload is more demanding. It becomes a tradeoff between silence and performance, and in the case of the Z83-F, it leans heavily towards silence, to the detriment of sustained high performance.



# :hammer_and_wrench: The objective :checkered_flag:.
The main objective of this project was to improve the cooling system, but that focus shifted as I made the first changes, and additional modifications gradually accumulated. Ultimately, the objectives became:
- Improve the cooling system: Lower temperatures and prevent sudden system shutdowns.
- Add support for Wi-Fi.
- Extend storage capacity.
- Enhance aesthetics.
