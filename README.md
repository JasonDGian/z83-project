<!-- # ðŸ“Œ Minisforum Z83-F mod project.
Greetings, and welcome to my Minisforum Mini PC mod project!   
In this repository, Iâ€™ll be documenting my journey as I analyze, test, and enhance the performance and functionality of the Minisforum Mini PC, tackling the shortcomings I've encountered during its use.   

The Z83-F is a capable mini PC for lightweight tasks, but its design limitations become evident under increased workloads. When pushed harder, it often struggles and may even **shut down unexpectedly**. This project is focused on addressing these issues to improve the device's overall performance and reliability. I plan to use it as a small home server for various lightweight applications, but even light usage can occasionally present challenges.

## :bust_in_silhouette: A little bit about me.
Before diving into the project, here's some context: Iâ€™m a tinkerer who thrives on hands-on projects like this one. While some might view these 'useless projects' as a waste of time, they actually keep me engaged and help me learn more about electronics, operating systems, programming, and IT. I find making and fixing mistakes far more productive than passively watching YouTube tutorials. For me, no time spent on this project is truly wasted as long as I learn something.

## :computer: About the device.

The Minisforum Z83-F is a compact fanless and silent _**System-on-a-Chip**_ mini computer. It sports an **Intel Atom x5-Z8350** processor with **4GB of DDR3 RAM** and a **64GB SSD**. It also comes pre-loaded with Windows 10 Pro.

The Z83-F also offers connectivity options such as Wi-Fi 2.4GHz/5.8GHz and Bluetooth 4.0, allowing for seamless wireless connectivity with other devices. With ports including USB 2.0, USB 3.0, HDMI, VGA, and an SD card slot, you have a variety of options for connecting peripherals and expanding storage.
For a more detailed exporation of the system hardware see the [detailed hardware analysis](hardware.md) section.

## :clipboard: The problems and shortcomings of the device.   
- :triangular_flag_on_post: **Poor heat dissipation:** The Minisforum Z83-F, like many mini PCs, features a fanless design for quiet operation and reduced power consumption. However, this design choice leads to poor heat dissipation, resulting in higher temperatures and potential performance issues. While fanless designs prioritize silence, they often sacrifice effective thermal management, impacting the device's longevity and performance, especially under heavier workloads. In the case of the Z83-F, the emphasis on silence comes at the cost of sustained high performance.

- :triangular_flag_on_post: **Limited Storage Capacity:** The device's 64GB onboard NAND memory is insufficient for my needs. To address this, I plan to attach an additional SSD. However, this leads to another challenge:

- :triangular_flag_on_post: **No SATA Ports:** The device lacks SATA ports, so I will need to find a solution to add the SATA SSD.
  
- :triangular_flag_on_post: **Hardware compatibility:** The hardware resources are limited and present some compatibility issues that need to be adressed, more on this on later.


# :hammer_and_wrench: The objective :checkered_flag:.
The main objective of this project was to improve the cooling system, but that focus shifted as I made the first changes, and additional modifications gradually accumulated. Ultimately, the objectives became:
- Improve the cooling system: Lower temperatures and prevent sudden system shutdowns.
- Add support for Wi-Fi.
- Extend storage capacity.
- Enhance aesthetics.

The Z83-F is a capable mini PC for lightweight tasks, but its design limitations become evident under heavier workloads. When pushed, it often struggles and may even **shut down unexpectedly**. This project aims to tackle these issues, improving the device's overall performance and reliability. I plan to use it as a small home server for various lightweight applications, but even light usage can present challenges in its current state.

## :bust_in_silhouette: A Little About Me

Iâ€™m a tinkerer at heart who thrives on hands-on projects like this one. While some may see these 'useless projects' as a waste of time, they actually keep me engaged and deepen my knowledge of electronics, operating systems, programming, and IT. For me, making and fixing mistakes is far more productive than passively watching YouTube tutorials. No time spent on this project is truly wasted as long as I learn something.

## :clipboard: Problems and Shortcomings

- :triangular_flag_on_post: **Poor Heat Dissipation:** The fanless design, while quiet and energy-efficient, leads to poor heat dissipation, resulting in higher temperatures and potential performance issues. This trade-off impacts the device's longevity and performance, especially under heavier workloads.
- :triangular_flag_on_post: **Slow OS and Frequent Freezes:** Windows 10 Pro is too resource-intensive for this machine, leading to severe slowdowns and frequent freezes. Even simple tasks, such as browsing YouTube, have proven to be excessively demanding for the device.

- :triangular_flag_on_post: **Limited Storage Capacity:** The 64GB onboard NAND is insufficient. I plan to add an SSD, but this introduces another challenge...

- :triangular_flag_on_post: **No SATA Ports:** The lack of SATA ports requires finding a solution to integrate an SSD.

- :triangular_flag_on_post: **Hardware Compatibility:** The limited hardware resources present compatibility issues that need addressing, which will be explored further.

## :checkered_flag: Objectives
Initially focused on just enhancing the cooling system, the project evolved as new ideas and changes emerged. The updated objectives are:

- **Enhance the Cooling System:** Lower temperatures and prevent sudden shutdowns.
- **Switch to a Lighter OS:** Replace Windows 10 Pro with a more efficient operating system better suited for low-resource machines.
- **Resolve Wi-Fi Compatibility Issues:** Fix any connectivity problems.
- **Extend Storage Capacity:** Increase the available storage.
- **Improve the Casing:** Upgrade the case to accommodate the new components and protect the hardware.

## :construction: Available Tools
In my toolkit, I have an FDM 3D printer, a resin printer, several photo printers, and a range of electronics and software tools. Additionally, Iâ€™ll be utilizing spare parts such as 40mm and 30mm fans, Wi-Fi cards, sound cards, and more.
