# ðŸ“Œ Installing a new OS.
The pre-loaded Windows 10 Pro was simply too much for the machine. It kept slowing down and freezing constantly and the overall experience with a simple web browser like Vivaldi was inssuferable, therefore i decided that one of the first things to do was install a new operating system with lower requireements and with less bloatware.

## Choosing the new OS.
This was quite a task. I started reading online and asking in forums for other user's experiences with this device, if someone had tested any OS with it and if were there any compatibility issues known to them. Among the candidates I took notice of the following linux distributions.
- Lubuntu - https://lubuntu.me/
- PuppyOs - https://puppylinux-woof-ce.github.io/
- Antix - https://antixlinux.com/
- MiniOS - https://minios.dev/es/
- Android - https://www.android.com/versions/kit-kat-4-4/
- Linux Mint - https://linuxmint.com/
- Bodhi - https://www.bodhilinux.com/

Most of these distros are lightweight and are great for low specs devices like mine, they can give new life to old hardware. The problem i found with most of these distros is compatibility issues with the NAND
storage and the wifi card. Antix seemed to be one of the best candidates alongside Lubuntu. MiniOs, Bodhi, and PuppyOS gave me constant trouble during installation because they were unable to detect the 
eMMC nand storage as a valid destination 
for the installation.
