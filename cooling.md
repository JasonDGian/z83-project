# 📌 Improving the Cooling System
One of the main issues with the device is its tendency to overheat quickly, particularly with the pre-installed Windows 10 Pro, which causes frequent freezes and even shutdowns. I suspect that overheating, combined with the device's limited RAM, 
is the root cause of these problems. This document will track my progress in addressing these cooling issues.

## 🔍 Analyzing the board.
An interesting note is that, from the manufacturer, the board did not have any thermal pad between the ram and the heatsink nor did it have cooling for the PMIC (power management integrated circuit).

 ## stats.
 I tested temperatures just playing a video on youtube using the firefox browser. In both cases I used the same exact video from start to finish (20mins) and between tests 1 hour passed in a 30ºc airconditioned room. The device was not in the 'air shot' of the air conditioner.
